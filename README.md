# [The corporate jet files](https://ig.ft.com/sites/business-jets/)

An FT investigation into executivesâ€™ personal use of company planes at the biggest US companies.

The biggest publicly listed US companies spent $40m last year giving free flights on corporate jets to some of their highest-paid executives.

The Financial Times analysed more than a thousand securities filings to look into this contentious practice and found that a small group of companies, roughly 10 per cent of the S&P 500, accounted for two-thirds of total spending on personal use of corporate aircraft.
