Company,MessageOccidential,We have nothing to add beyond what was reported in the proxy statement. Thank you.CBS,Confirming those are the numbers in the proxy â€“ but on background â€“ the numbers overstate the amount as explained in the footnote in the proxy because it includes the personal use of a car and driver. We decline to comment on your additional questions. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank youConstallation,"Thank you again for reaching out. We would like to provide the following company statement. We offer our named executive officers the use of our corporate aircraft both to enhance their security and to permit them to devote maximum time and attention to our business while away from our offices. The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors reviews each element of executive compensation annually, including perquisites such as the personal use of company aircraft. Constellation Leasing, a wholly owned company subsidiary, owns or leases company aircraft. Spend per our 2014 proxy: Rob Sands --$625,431, Richard Sands -- $409,688 Thank you,"Facebook,"We wonâ€™t be commenting but you can pull from the proxy, specifically p. 25 that notes the reasoning for the use of the aircraft. p. 25 â€“ â€œBecause of the high visibility of our company we have implemented an ""overall security program"" for Mr. Zuckerberg to address safety concerns resulting from his position as our founder, Chairman, and CEO. We require these security measures for the company's benefit because of the importance of Mr. Zuckerberg to Facebook, and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary.â€ù When will you be publishing? Thanks for reaching out!"Google,"Thanks for your email. Yes the 672.4k is right. And here's what we have said in our Proxy about this; I don't have further information: Pursuant to our Non-Commercial Aircraft Policy, executives and their guests may use company aircraft with appropriate approvals and pay tax on any associated imputed income. The aggregate incremental cost of personal use of the company aircraft is calculated based on a cost-per-flight-hour charge developed by a nationally recognized and independent service. The charge reflects the direct operating cost of the aircraft, including fuel, additives and lubricants, an allocable allowance for airframe, engine and APU maintenance and restoration, crew travel expenses, on board catering, and trip-related landing/hangar/ramp fees and parking costs. This charge does not include any fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as pilotsâ€™ and other employeesâ€™ salaries, home hanger expenses, and general taxes and insurance The $672,400 for personal use of aircraft was for aircraft chartered by Google for an annual conference. Cheers!"Ford,Happy to hear that you the correct number from our proxy statement. The Ford board of directors requires both the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman to travel on private aircraft to ensure secure and efficient transportation. The cost for this service is disclosed in our proxy statement and reported as income for the executives. If you would give me a call â€“ I would be happy to answer the questions you sent. Please give me a call. P&G,"Thanks for reaching out to our media team. That is the correct figure for P&Gâ€™s FY 2014 (ended 6/30/14). For security reasons, P&Gâ€™s CEO has been required by the Board of Directors for many years to use Company aircraft for all air travel, including personal travel. After his prior retirement from P&G in 2009, Mr. Lafley relocated his permanent home to Florida. At the request of the Board of Directors, he agreed to come out of retirement and rejoin the Company in 2013 as CEO. This figure includes the personal travel costs associated with his travel between Florida and Cincinnati during his tenure as CEO, due to his need to live and work in Cincinnati, while also returning to be with family at his Florida home. The Company reviews executive benefits regularly to assure they continue to fulfill business needs and are consistent with prevalent market practice."Dreiling/Dollar General,"Notes from phone call: Number is correct for 2013. Mr Dreiling is retired now and the current executive's contract doesn't allow for personal aircraft use. That's why there is no disclosure in 2014. ""It's irrelevent for us now... We don't - our current CEO doesn't have that in his contract... Rick is retired... We don't have that issue any more."""Mylan,You can refer to our 2014 10kA. Don't think we will have anything to add beyond the detail included in that. Addresses most of your questions Freeport-McMoRan,The information is correct. No further comment beyond what was in the proxy. Swanson/ Raytheon,All the information we can offer is in our proxy documents which you have already found. Any sense of when your research will be published? Boeing,"$868847 for PUCA is correct, being the sum of values for the executives listed in the proxy. 1. Why has the board approved PUCA for company executives? Business jets are a productivity tool, used by our CEO and senior executives, allowing them to maximize their availability and productivity. Using a corporate jet also considers the security of our senior executives. Also, with an entry in the business jet marketplace (Boeing BBJ), use of such a jet by our executives helps demonstrates their value to potential customers. Our CEO is required to use the aircraft for all flights. 2. If the reason is security, has there been a specific security threat? We typically wouldnâ€™t comment on that. 3. Are there any plans to reassess or revise the company PUCA policy? No. 4. Has the board reassessed or revised the company PUCA policy in recent years? We constantly evaluate our business processes but no, no change has been made. 5. Could you provide a breakdown of the primary purpose of the flights? Use of these flights was split between attendance at outside board meetings and personal travel. 6. From where does the company source its corporate aircraft? E.g: a. Outright ownership b. Fractional ownership c. Leasing d. Card service The fleet is principally owned outright with some leasing and fractional ownership. "Davita,The numbers look close based on my review. Plane transportation is included as part of the larger board-approved pay package and it comes in lieu of other compensation.IAC,We are not able to comment beyond what is listed in the proxy statements for 2013 and 2014. Thank you! Expedia,"After reviewing internally, I think any of the questions we would comment on are part of our public disclosures already so we don't have any further comment. I do want to make sure you have the disclosure that our CEO reimburses for his use."Tyson,"John Tysonâ€™s personal use of company aircraft is clearly outlined in his board compensation committee-approved employment contract and further described in our annual proxy statement. While the Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies like ours to disclose the incremental cost of personal aircraft use it doesnâ€™t define how that cost should be calculated. As a result, other companies may calculate their aircraft expenses differently than we do. For more information, we encourage you to use the links below.
